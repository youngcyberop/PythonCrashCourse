# Changing, Adding, and Removing list elements
#   Changing: vehicles[0] = 'Honda 4-wheeler'
#   Append elements to the end of the list
#       Append elements: vehicles.append('Honda Civic')
#       You can build an empty list and append new values
#   Inserting elements into a list
#       vehicles.insert(0, 'Honda hybrid')
#   Removing elements from a list
#       del vehicles[1]
#   Removing an Item using the pop() method
#       Pop method() removes an item from the end of the list and stores it in a new variable
#       Note: popped items are no longer stored in the list
#           popped_vehicles = vehicles.pop()
#       An example use case for this might be to describe the last vehicle you owned,
#       if they were stored in a list in chronological order and you wanted to print that vehicle
#   Pop items from any position in a list
#       first_owned = vehicles.pop(0)
#   Removing an item by value
#       vehicles.remove('Honda Civic')
#       Alternatively, you could define another variable to specify the value that's being removed:
#            removed_vehicle = 'Honda Civic'
#            vehicles.remove(removed_vehicle)

#   sort() method will sort list alphabetically permanently
#   sort(reverse=True) will sort list reverse alphabetically
#   sorted() function will sort list alphabetically temporarily
#   sorted(reverse=True) function will sort list reverse alphabetically temporarily
#   reverse() method will reverse the order of the list permanently
#   len() function will print the length of a list, starting at 1
